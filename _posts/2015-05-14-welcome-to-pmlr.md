mlr.press is a potential new home for the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, part of the JMLR stable of journals. We are trying to streamline the procedure for publishing workshop and conference proceedings by making use of as many mordern facilities as possible. These pages are hosted on a public github repository where the journal will reside.
