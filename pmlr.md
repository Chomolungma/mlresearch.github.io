The Proceedings of Machine Learning Research is a series
aimed specifically at publishing work presented at workshops and
conferences. Each volume is separately titled and associated with a
particular workshop or conference and will be pulished online on the
PMLR web site. Authors will retain copyright and individual volume
editors are free to make additional hardcopy publishing arrangements
(see for example the [Challenges in Machine
Learning](http://www.mtome.com/Publications/CiML/ciml.html) series which
includes free PDFs and low cost hard copies), but JMLR will not produce
hardcopies of these volumes.
