JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings Frequently Asked Questions
===================================================================

The JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings are very much a community
effort. Thanks are particularly due to [Isabelle
Guyon](http://www.clopinet.com/isabelle) for working closely with us in
preparing early volumes, [Nicola
Talbot](http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/) for preparing the LaTeX
class file and [Leslie Pack Kaelbling](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/)
for supporting the launch in the first place.

How do I publish my proceedings with you?
-----------------------------------------

Email the series editor with your planned event. You need to provide
brief CVs of the organizers and an overview of the subject matter.
Potential proceedings are judged on the basis of the appropriateness of
the material, the perceived quality of the workshop and the track record
of the organizers.

What Volume Number will my Proceedings be?
------------------------------------------

When you are close to finalizing the proceedings, email the series
editor. He will give you a volume number by allocating from those
currently available.

What if I want a Paper Copy?
----------------------------

You are free to organize a hard copy of your proceedings for your
workshop, although JMLR does not provide the support for this. Previous
editors have made use of Microtome. See the [Challenges in Machine
Learning](http://www.mtome.com/Publications/CiML/ciml.html) series here
which is made up of volumes from JMLR W&CP. [Nicola
Talbot](http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/) has created a LaTeX
[package](http://www.dickimaw-books.com/apps/makejmlrbookgui/) for
creating books from the proceedings.

Should the Call for Papers be Before or After the Workshop?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is up to you. You can make the proceedings a pre-proceedings or a
post-proceedings. Some conferences, like AISTATS 2010, do the call
before the workshop and put the proceedings on line in time for the
event. Other will finalize their proceedings after the event.

What is the Style File for the Proceedings?
-------------------------------------------

There are two style files, a two column style file (see for example the
AISTATS volumes) or a one column style file similar to the standard JMLR
style. As of 2010 [Nicola Talbot](http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/)
has kindly put together a LaTeX package for these styles. It is
available
[here](http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/jmlr.html).
We don't support preparation systems other than LaTeX.

### Software for Supporting Proceedings Preparation

As of 2012 [Nicola Talbot](http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~nlct/) has
prepared a Java Application for assisting in preparing a JMLR
proceedings. It is available
[here](http://www.dickimaw-books.com/apps/makejmlrbookgui/). Many thanks
to Nicola.

What do I Need to Provide for the Proceedings?
----------------------------------------------

You should appoint a publications chair (who could also be one of the
editors, but needn't be: for larger conferences it is often a separate
role, but for smaller workshops it tends to be an editor). The
publications chair will be responsible for compiling the proceedings.

The proceedings are provided in the format detailed [here](./spec.html).

As well as the papers in the format described above, you will need to
provide permission to publish forms from your authors. Please distribute
the form found [here](jmlrPublicationForm.pdf) to your authors. Have
them sign a copy and send you a scanned PDF. The scanned PDF should be
named with the convention given above with the suffice `Permission` e.g.
`turner10aPermission.pdf`. These files should be placed in a *separate*
directory from the other material called `vXpermissions` and sent the
series editor.
